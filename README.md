<h3>HTML</h3>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

<h3>MySQL</h3>

MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows. Although it can be used in a wide range of applications, MySQL is most often associated with web applications and online publishing.

MySQL is an important component of an open source enterprise stack called LAMP. LAMP is a web development platform that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL as the relational database management system and PHP as the object-oriented scripting language. (Sometimes Perl or Python is used instead of PHP.)

Originally conceived by the Swedish company MySQL AB, MySQL was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008 and then by Oracle when it bought Sun in 2010. Developers can use MySQL under the GNU General Public License (GPL), but enterprises must obtain a commercial license from Oracle.

Today, MySQL is the RDBMS behind many of the top websites in the world and countless corporate and consumer-facing web-based applications, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

<h3>How MySQL works</h3>
MySQL is based on a client-server model. The core of MySQL is MySQL server, which handles all of the database instructions (or commands). MySQL server is available as a separate program for use in a client-server networked environment and as a library that can be embedded (or linked) into separate applications.

MySQL operates along with several utility programs which support the administration of MySQL databases. Commands are sent to MySQLServer via the MySQL client, which is installed on a computer.

MySQL was originally developed to handle large databases quickly. Although MySQL is typically installed on only one machine, it is able to send the database to multiple locations, as users are able to access it via different MySQL client interfaces. These interfaces send SQL statements to the server and then display the results.
